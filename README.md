## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the Java Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Java implementations for various data structures and algorithms, along with explanations and examples for each.

## 📁 Data Structures

### 1. Array 
-  Implementation of basic operations on arrays such as insertion, deletion, and searching.


### 2. LinkedList 
-  Implementation of a singly linked list with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.


### 3. Stack 
-  Implementation of a stack using arrays with push, pop, and isEmpty operations.


### 4. Queue 
-  Implementation of a queue using arrays with enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty operations.


### 5. BinarySearchTree 
-   Implementation of a binary search tree with insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.


### 6. Graph 
-  Implementation of a graph using adjacency list representation with BFS and DFS traversal algorithms.


## 📚 Algorithms

### 1. Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort:** 
- **Selection Sort:** 
- **Insertion Sort:** 

### 2. Searching Algorithms

- **Linear Search:** [LinearSearch.java]
- **Binary Search:** [BinarySearch.java]

## 🧩 Usage

To use these implementations, clone the repository and run the Java files in your favorite IDE or compile them using the Java compiler.

```bash
